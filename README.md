# Heart-Failure-Prediction-ML-Model
I310D Final Project - Longhorns

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<body> 
<b>Problem:</b> Globally, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) claim approximately 17.9 million lives
annually as the leading cause of death, accounting for 31% of all deaths worldwide. 80% of CVD
deaths are caused by heart attacks and strokes, and a third of these deaths occur prematurely in
individuals under the age of 70. Our goal is to identify signs and risks of heart disease based on their attributes.
<br>
<b>Data:</b> Dataset of heart failure attributes and their classifications. Found on kaggle.com license Open Database License (ODbL), which allows for sharing and adaptation of the datasets for any purpose. Click <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction?resource=download">here</a> for dataset
  
<b>Method:</b> Supervised machine learning model (Logistic Regression classifier) in Python to predict individuals with heart disease (Class 1) vs. individuals without heart disease (Class 0) as a binary classification.
